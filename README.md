# Email Spam Gateway

This project is an intelligent **email filtering system** that connects to a Gmail inbox, classifies incoming emails as **SPAM** or **HAM** using a machine learning model, and logs the results to the **ELK Stack** for real-time monitoring and visualization.

---

## What It Does

- Connects to Gmail using the Gmail API
- Fetches the latest emails and their metadata
- Classifies them using a trained ML model (`spam_classifier.pkl`)
- Logs results in JSON format and forwards them to Elasticsearch
- Visualizes logs and spam detection stats in **Kibana**

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Authenticates with Gmail using OAuth
2. Fetches recent email metadata and snippet
3. Extracts headers (e.g. `From`, `Subject`, SPF, DKIM)
4. Predicts if the email is **SPAM** or **HAM**
5. Logs structured data to a JSON file and ELK
